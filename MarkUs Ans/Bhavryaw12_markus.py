Complete the following steps:

(1) The starter code below contains the instructions for three past exam
    questions. Each function has a docstring provided, and you will write the
    body. The past exam the question is taken from is indicated in a comment.
(2) Test your functions in the Wing101 shell by evaluating the examples from
    the docstrings and confirming that the correct result is displayed. You can
    also uncomment doctest.testmod() to try running the docstring examples for
    a quicker way to test.
(3) When convinced that your functions are correct, submit your modified file
    to MarkUs. You can find instructions on submitting a file to MarkUs
    in the Week *2* Perform on PCRS.
(4) We have also provided a checker for you to run in MarkUs. * NOTE: Unlike in
    the previous Performs, we are providing you with the full set of tests so
    that you will be able to use them to check your work. This also means you
    will know if you earned full marks or not.
