he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that's a lie
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck
on back roads at night
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
september saw a month of tears
and thankin' god that you weren't here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
it's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
and lookin' back on all of that it's nice to believe
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
and i'm back for the first time since then
i'm standin' on your street
and there's a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that you'll read is:
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you'll turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
oh think of me
mmmm
he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that's a lie
state the obvious i didn't get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i'm obsessive and crazy
that's fine you won't mind if i say
by the way...
i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned
you're just another picture to burn!
there's no time for tears
i'm just sitting here planning my revenge
there's nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned
you're just another picture to burn!
and if you're missing me
you'd better keep it to yourself
'cause coming back around here
would be bad for your health...
'cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
in case you haven't heard
i really really hate that...
stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i'm concerned
you're just another picture to burn!
burn burn burn baby burn
you're just another picture to burn
baby burn...
drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
that i want and i'm needing
everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful that girl he talks about
and she's got everything that i have to live without
drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's just so funny
that i can't even see
anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he's all i think about at night
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing. don't know why i do
drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she'd better hold him tight give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing. don't know why i do
so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight
'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing. don't know why i do
he's the time taken up but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into
drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
i don't know what i want so don't ask me
'cause i'm still trying to figure it out
don't know what's down this road i'm just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though i'm not the only one
who feels the way i do
i'm alone on my own and that's all i know
i'll be strong i'll be wrong oh but life goes on
oh i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
got the radio on my old blue jeans
and i'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today got the sunshine
could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrow's just a mystery oh yeah
but that's ok
i'm alone on my own and that's all i know
i'll be strong i'll be wrong oh but life goes on
oh i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
maybe i'm just a girl on a mission
but i'm ready to fly
i'm alone on my own and that's all i know
i'll be strong i'll be wrong oh but life goes on
oh i'm alone on my own and that's all i know
oh i'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
oh i'm just a girl
oh i'm just a girl oh oh
oh i'm just a girl
you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take you take the very best of me
so i start a fight 'cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want 'cause i'm not what you wanted
oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
just walk away ain't no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you
you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
and i stood there loving you and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
so just walk away ain't no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you
you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried cried for you
and i know you wouldn't have told nobody if i died died for you died for you
oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
and now that i'm sitting here thinking it through
i've never been anywhere cold as you
i didn't know what i would find
when i went looking for a reason
i know i didn't read between the lines
and baby i've got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right?
so how can i ever try to be better?
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
and i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside
you saw me there but never knew
that i would give it all up to be
a part of this a part of you
and now it's all too late. so you see
you could've helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until it's too late to do anything
so how can i ever try to be better?
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
and i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside
oh yeah
so how can i ever try to be better?
nobody ever lets me in
and i can still see you
this ain't the best view
on the outside looking in
and i've been a lot of lonely places
i've never been on the outside
seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking you're not pretty
but that's not true 'cause i know you
hold on baby you're losing it
the water's high you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone
i guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh 'cause it's not his price to pay
it's not his price to pay
hold on baby you're losing it
the water's high you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone
hold on baby you're losing it
the water's high you're jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry but you don't tell anyone
that you might not be the golden one
and you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone
you're tied together with a smile
but you're coming undone
goodbye baby
with a smile baby baby
cory's eyes are like a jungle
he smiles it's like the radio
he whispers songs into my window
in words that nobody knows
there's pretty girls on every corner
that watch him as he's walking home
saying does he know?
will you ever know?
you're beautiful
every little piece love
and don't you know
you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh but if it don't
stay beautiful
cory finds another way to be
the highlight of my day
i'm taking pictures in my mind
so i can save them for a rainy day
it's hard to make a conversation
when he's taking my breath away
i should say hey by the way
you're beautiful
every little piece love
and don't you know
you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my door
oh but if it don't
stay beautiful
if you and i are a story
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream
i'll never get to hold
at least you'll know
you're beautiful
every little piece love
and don't you know
you're really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life leads you back to my front door
oh but if it don't
will you stay
beautiful beautiful beautiful
beautiful beautiful beautiful?
la la la
oh oh oh oh
oh but if it don't
stay beautiful
stay beautiful
na na na na na
it's strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles the flowers everything is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even now just looking at you feels wrong
you say that you'd take it all back given one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes.
you should've said no you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd
get back to me get back to me.
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why?
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said no baby and you might still have me
you can see that i've been crying
and baby you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same?
you say that the past is the past you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes.
you should've said no you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd
get back to me get back to me.
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why?
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said no baby and you might still have me
i can't resist
before you go tell me this:
was it worth it?
was she worth this?
no... no no no...
you should've said no you should've gone home
you should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should've known that word
'bout what you did with her'd
get back to me get back to me.
and i should've been there in the back of your mind
i shouldn't be asking myself why?
you shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
you should've said no baby and you might still have me
she said i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids you and i
oh my my my my
well i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasn't that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we'd really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my
take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two a.m. riding in your truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside 'til the morning light
oh my my my my
a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me got down on one knee
take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we'll rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time you and i
i'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
i'll still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky oh my my my
i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around turn the radio down
he says baby is something wrong?
i say nothin' i was just thinkin'
how we don't have a song
and he says
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date: man i didn't kiss her and i should have
and when i got home 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
i was walking up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong or been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway well on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost didn't notice all the roses
and the note that said
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tapping on your window
when we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date: man i didn't kiss her and i should have
and when i got home 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
da-da-da-da
i've heard every album listened to the radio
waited for somethin' to come along
that was as good as our song
'cause our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tappin' on his window
when we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date: man i didn't kiss him and i should have
and when i got home 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
play it again oh yeah
oh oh yeah
i was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song
friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we don't say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i don't wanna live without you
i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only tryna
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you
just a small-town boy and girl
living in a crazy world
tryna figure out what is and isn't true
and i don't try to hide my tears
my secrets or my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you can't live without me
i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only tryna
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me when i'm with you
when i'm with anybody else
it's so hard to be myself
and only you can tell
that i'm only up when you're not down
don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
it's like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i'm only tryna
let you know that what i feel is true
and i'm only me who i wanna be
well i'm only me when i'm with you
with you
uh-huh yeah
she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
she'll never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by
and you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
but you are everything to me
and i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle
unbelievable
instead of just invisible
oh yeah
there's a fire inside of you
that can't help but shine through
she's never gonna see the light
no matter what you do
and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be
i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
she's never gonna love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle
unbelievable
instead of just invisible
like shadows in a faded light
oh we're invisible
i just wanna open your eyes
and make you realize
i just wanna show you
she don't even know you
baby let me love you
let me want you
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle
unbelievable
instead of just invisible
oh yeah
she can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
maybe i should've seen the signs
should've read the writing on the wall
and realized by the distance in your eyes that i would be the one to fall
no matter what you say i still can't believe
that you would walk away
it don't make sense to me but
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
it's not unbroken anymore
how do i get it back the way it was before?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break? why would you wanna break it?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now?
why would you wanna make the very first scar?
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see
what i want and i need
and everything that we should be
i'll bet she's beautiful
that girl he talks about
and she's got everything
that i have to live without
drew talks to me
i laugh 'cause it's just so funny
but i can't even see
anyone when he's with me
he says he's so in love
he's finally got it right
i wonder if he knows
he's all i think about at night
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do
drew walks by me
can he tell that i can't breathe?
and there he goes so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she better hold him tight
give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes
and know she's lucky 'cause
he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do
so i drive home alone
as i turn out the light
i'll put his picture down
and maybe get some sleep tonight
'cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
he's the song in the car i keep singing
don't know why i do
he's the time taken up but there's never enough
and he's all that i need to fall into
drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he won't see there's something 'bout the way
the street looks when it's just rained
there's a glow off the pavement you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot yeah
oh yeah
we're driving down the road i wonder if you know
i'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
but you're just so cool run your hands through your hair
absent-mindedly making me want you
and i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless
so baby drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one-horse town
i wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it remember it
cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless
oh oh
well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake i'm not usually this way but
you pull me in and i'm a little more brave
it's the first kiss it's flawless really something
it's fearless
oh yeah
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless
'cause i don't know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first fearless
and i don't know why but with you i'd dance
in a storm in my best dress fearless
oh oh
oh-oh yeah
you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it's the mornin' of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
for the next four years in this town
hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i haven't seen you around before
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know who you're gonna be
at fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you're best friends
laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
we'll be outta here as soon as we can
and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
and you're feelin' like flyin'
and your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
and you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
'cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin around well
in your life you'll do things greater than
datin' the boy on the football team
i didn't know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was gonna marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had
to a boy who changed his mind
and we both cried
cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you're gonna believe them
and when you're fifteen don't forget to look before you fall
but i've found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you're supposed to be
i didn't know who i was supposed to be
at fifteen
la-la-la la-la-la la-la-la-la
la-la-la la-la-la la-la-la-la
la-la-la la-la-la
your very first day
take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
i'm standing there
on a balcony in summer air
see the lights see the party the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say hello
little did i know
that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you please don't go and i said
romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes
so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while oh oh
'cause you were romeo i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
but you were everything to me
i was begging you please don't go and i said
romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
it's a love story baby just say yes
romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult but it's real
don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess
it's a love story baby just say yes
oh oh
and i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town
and i said romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head? i don't know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone
i love you and that's all i really know
i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
it's a love story baby just say 'yes'
oh oh oh
oh oh oh
'cause we were both young when i first saw you
mmm-mm mm-mm
mmm-mm mm-mm
mmm-mm mm-mm yeah
hey stephen i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you
and as we walked we were talking
i didn't say half the things i wanted to
of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
i'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
hey stephen boy you might have me believing
i don't always have to be alone
'cause i can't help it if you look like an angel
can't help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i've been feeling since i met you
can't help it if there's no one else
mmm i can't help myself
hey stephen i've been holding back this feeling
so i got some things to say to you

but i never seen nobody shine the way you do
the way you walk way you talk way you say my name
it's beautiful wonderful don't you ever change
hey stephen why are people always leaving?

as i paced back and forth all this time
'cause i honestly believed in you
holdin' on the days drag on
stupid girl i shoulda known i shoulda known
that i'm not a princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to come around
maybe i was naive got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake i didn't know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams about you and me
happy endings now i know
that i'm not a princess this ain't a fairytale
i'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
this ain't hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to come around
and there you are on your knees
beggin' for forgiveness beggin' for me
just like i always wanted
but i'm so sorry
'cause i'm not your princess this ain't our fairytale
i'm gonna find someone someday
who might actually treat me well
this is a big world that was a small town
there in my rearview mirror disappearing now
and it's too late for you and your white horse
now it's too late for you and your white horse
to catch me now
oh whoa whoa whoa
try and catch me now oh
it's too late to catch me now
you're on the phone with your girlfriend she's upset
she's going off about something that you said
'cause she doesn't get your humor like i do
i'm in my room it's a typical tuesday night
i'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
and she'll never know your story like i do
cause she wears short skirts i wear t-shirts
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time
if you could see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along so why can't you see?
you belong with me you belong with me
walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
hey isn't this easy?
and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
i haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say you're fine i know you better than that
hey whatcha doing with a girl like that?
she wears high heels i wear sneakers
she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you're looking for has been here the whole time
if you could see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along so why can't you see?
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know baby?
you belong with me you belong with me
oh i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
i'm the one who makes you laugh
when you know you're 'bout to cry
i know your favorite songs
and you tell me 'bout your dreams
think i know where you belong
think i know it's with me
can't you see that i'm the one who understands you
been here all along so why can't you see?
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know baby?
you belong with me you belong with me
you belong with me
have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me?
you belong with me
i see your face in my mind as i drive away
'cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
people are people and sometimes we change our minds
but it's killing me to see you go after all this time
mm-mm mm-mm-mm-mm
mm-mm mm-mm-mm-mm
the music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
it's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
now i don't know what to be without you around
and we know it's never simple never easy
never a clean breakno one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand
and i can'tbreathe without you but i have to
breathe without you but i have to
never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
every little bump in the road i tried to swerve
but people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
and nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout
and we know it's never simple never easy
never a clean breakno one here to save me
you're the only thing i know like the back of my hand
and i can'tbreathe without you but i have to
breathe without you but i have to
it's 2 a.m. feeling like i justlost a friend

and we know it's never simple never easy

i took a chance i took a shot
and you might think i'm bulletproof but i'm not
you took a swing i took it hard
and down here from the ground i see who you are
i'm sick and tired of your attitude
i'm feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you love me then cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why
well you could write a book on
how to ruin someone's perfect day
well i get so confused and frustrated
forget what i'm tryin' to say oh
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
makes me run for cover when you're around
here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why
why do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside?
why do you have to put down my dreams
so you're the only thing on my mind?
i'm sick and tired of your attitude
feeling like i don't know you
you tell me that you want me then cut me down
i'm sick and tired of your reasons
i've got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love then you push me around
here's to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you're doin' to me
tell me why why
tell me why oh
i take a step back i let you go
i told you i'm not bulletproof
now you know
all this time i was wasting hoping you would come around
i've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
and it's taken me this long baby but i've figured you out
and you're thinking we'll be fine again but not this time around
you don't have to call anymore
i won't pick up the phone

don't wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you're sorry
but i don't believe you baby like i did before
you're not sorry
no no oh-oh
you're looking so innocent i might believe you if i didn't know
could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
and you've got your share of secrets
and i'm tired of being last to know oh
and now you're asking me to listen
'cause it's worked each time before
but you don't have to call anymore

he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear and it's like
i couldn't ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you act insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
he's close to my mother
talks business with my father
he's charming and endearing
and i'm comfortable
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
you're so in love that you acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you
he can't see the smile i'm faking
and my heart's not breaking
'cause i'm not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating
intoxicating complicated
got away by some mistake and now
i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
it's 2am and i'm cursing your name
i'm so in love that i acted insane
and that's the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it's a rollercoaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you oh oh
whoa whoa oh-oh oh
and that's the way i loved you oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh whoa
never knew i could feel that much
and that's the way i loved you
once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding?
'cause it seems to me
this thing is breaking down we almost never speak
i don't feel welcome anymore
baby what happened? please tell me
'cause one second it was perfect
now you're halfway out the door
and i stare at the phone he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
was i out of line?
did i say something way too honest made you run and hide
like a scared little boy?
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute now i'm not so sure
so here's to everything coming down to nothing
here's to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going?
thought i knew for a minute but i don't anymore
and i stare at the phone he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
you didn't mean it baby i don't think so
oh back up baby back up
did you forget everything?
back up baby back up
did you forget everything?
'cause it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
oh i stare at the phone he still hasn't called
and then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said forever and always
and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'cause i was there when you said forever and always
you didn't mean it baby
you said forever and always yeah
i'm five years old it's getting cold i've got my big coat on
i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you i run and run
past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
look now the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
i don't know why all the trees change in the fall
but i know you're not scared of anything at all
don't know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today
i'm thirteen now
and don't know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
and we talk and window shop 'til i've forgotten all their names
i don't know who i'm going to talk to now at school
but i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you
don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day with you today
i have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother inside and out
he's better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you
there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
it's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
daddy's smart
and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
for staying back and watching me shine
and i didn't know if you knew so i'm taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you today
well it's a sad picture the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know it's all the same another time and place
repeating history and you're getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and i'll do anything to see it through
because these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and we'll sing hallelujah we'll sing hallelujah
oh oh
so we've been outnumbered raided and now cornered
it's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
we're getting stronger now find things they never found
they might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
you can walk away say we don't need this
but there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
'cause these things will change
can you feel it now?
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and we'll sing hallelujah we'll sing hallelujah
oh oh
tonight we'll stand get off our knees
fight for what we've worked for all these years
and the battle was long it's the fight of our lives
but we'll stand up champions tonight
it was the night things changed
can you see it now?
when the wallsthat they put up to hold us back fell down
it's a revolution throw your hands up
'cause we never gave in
and we'll sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
hallelujah

we're on the phone and without a warning
i realize your laugh is the best sound

who's desperately in love with you

it must have been the way you kissed me
fell in love when i saw you standing there
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
it must have been the way
today was a fairytale
oh oh yeah oh-oh
today was a fairytale
once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
shouldn't i find a stain but i never do
the way the tires turn stones on old county roads
they leave 'em muddy underneath reminds me of you
you find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
you know you can scratch it right off it's how it used to be
but like the dollar in your pocket it's been spent and traded in
you can't change where it's been reminds me of me
i lived and i learned had you got burned
held out and held on
god knows too long and wasted time
lost tears swore that i'd get out of here
but no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me
the best and worst day of june
was the one that i met you
with yourhands in your pockets
and your don't you wish you had me? grin
well i did so i smiled
and i melted like a child
now every breath of air i breathereminds me of then
and i lived and i learned had you got burned
held out and held on
god knows too long and wasted time
lost tears swore that i'd get out of here
but no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me
i lived and i learned
and found out what it was to turn around
and see that we
were never really meant to be
so i lied and i cried
and i watched a part of myself die
'cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
i've still got you all over me
i've still gotyou all over me
still got you all over me

we used to walk along the streets
when the porch lights were shining bright
before i had somewhere to be
back when we had all night and we were happy
i do recall a good while backwe snuck into the circus
you threw your arms around my neck back when i deserved it
and we were happy
when it was good baby it was good baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy
we used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
that's sorta how i feel right now
and goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy
when it was good baby it was good baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
and we were happy
we were happy
oh i hate those voices telling me i'm not in love anymore
but they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'cause we were happy
we were happy
when it was good baby it was good baby
we showed 'em all up
no one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
talking 'bout your daddy's farm
and you were gonna marry me
and we were happy
we were happy
oh-oh-oh-oh

to think about all of this

words were hard to hear
and harder to ever take back
and i said when can i-i-i come back?
and you said that's when
when i wake up in the morning

missed me if you don't want me again
you don't know how much i feel i love you still
so why don't you don't you?

it wasn't just like a movie
the rain didn't soak through my clothes down to my skin
i'm drivin' away and i i guess you could say
this is the last time i'll drive this way again
lost in the grayand i try to grab at the fray
'cause i i still love you but i can't
bye bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you bad but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
bye bye baby
bye bye baby
the picture frame is empty
on the dresser vacant just like me
i see your writing on the dash
then back to your hesitation
i was so sure of everything
everything i thought we'd always have
guess i never doubted it
then the here and the now floods in
feels like i'm becoming a part of your past
bye bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you bad but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
bye bye baby
and there's so much that i can't touch
you're all i want but it's not enough this time
and all the pages are just slipping through my hands
and i'm so scared of how this ends
bye bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you bad but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
bye bye to everything i thought was on my side
bye bye baby
i want you bad but it's come down to nothing
and all i have is your sympathy
'cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
oh you took me home i thought you were gonna keep me
bye bye baby
bye bye baby you were in college working part-time waiting tables
left a small town and never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
i say can you believe it?
as we're lying on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes yes i can see it now
do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
flash forward and we're taking on the world together
and there's a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and you figure out why i'm guarded
you say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes yes
this is what i thought about:
do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water?
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
and i remember that fight 2:30 am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
'cause that's all i've ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said i'll never leave you alone.
you said i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you it's like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that's ever been mine
hold on make it last
hold on never turn back
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that's ever been mine
yeah yeah
do you believe it? hold on
we're gonna make it now hold on
and i can see it
yeah yeah
i can see it now see it now
the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and i'm a house of cards
you're the kind of reckless
that should send me running
but i kinda know that i won't get far
and you stood there in front of me
just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you couldn't see
what i was thinking of
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
my mind forgets to remind me
you're a bad idea
you touch me once and it's really something
you find i'm even better than you imagined i would be
i'm on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you i know it's no good
and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
i run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keeping your eyes on me
it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase
won't you whisper soft and slow?
i'm captivated by you baby like a firework show
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile
and the sparks fly
oh baby smile
and the sparks fly
i'm so glad you made time to see me
how's life? tell me how's your family?
i haven't seen them in a while
you've been good busier than ever
we small talk work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why
because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i'd go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time
these days i haven't been sleeping
staying up playing back myself leaving
when your birthday passed and i didn't call
and i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watched you laughing from the passenger side and
realized i loved you in the fall
and then the cold came
the dark days when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i'd go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
i miss your tan skin your sweet smile
so good to me so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again i swear i'd love you right
i'd go back in time and change it but i can't
so if the chain is on your door i understand
but this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying i'm sorry for that night
and i go back to december
it turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
wishing i'd realized what i had when you were mine
i'd go back to december turn around and make it alright
i'd go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
all the time
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
this is surely not
what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say
don't say yes run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
fond gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play
a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited
by your lovely bride-to-be
she floats down the aisle
like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me don't you
don't say yes run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
don't say yes run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
your time is running out
and they said speak now
ooh la-da-da-da oh
ooh ooh
say a single vow
i hear the preacher say
speak now or forever hold your peace
there's the silence there's my last chance
i stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but i'm only looking at you
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
hehe!
so don't say yes run away now
i'll meet you when you're out
of the church at the back door
don't wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
and you say
let's run away now
i'll meet you when
i'm out of my tux at the back door
baby i didn't say my vows
so glad you were around when they said
'speak now'
long were the nights when
my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
praying the floor won't fall through... again
my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
then go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wonderin' which version of you i might get on the phone tonight
well i stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
dear john i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i shoulda known
well maybe it's me
and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it's you and your sick need
to give love and take it away
and you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
who don't understand
and i look back in regret how i ignored when they said
run as fast as you can
dear john i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john i see it all now it was wrong
don't you think nineteen's too young
to be played by your dark twisted games
when i loved you so?
i shoulda known
you are an expert at sorry
and keeping lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'cause you burned them out
but i took your matches
before fire could catch me
so don't look now
i'm shining like fireworks
over your sad empty town yeah
oh oh oh oh oh oh
dear john i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i see it all now that you're gone
don't you think i was too young to be messed with?
the girl in the dress wrote you a song
you shoulda known
you shoulda known
don't you think i was too young?
you shoulda known
you with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feeling like i'm nothing
you with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i'm wounded
you picking on the weaker man
well you can take me down
with just one single blow
but you don't know what you don't know
someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
you with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i don't already see them
i walk with my head down trying to block you out
'cause i'll never impress you
i just wanna feel okay again
i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
'cause you can't lead me down that road
and you don't know what you don't know
someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big loud opinion
but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i can't sing
but all you are is mean
all you are is mean
and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
and mean and mean and mean and mean
but someday i'll be living in a big old city
and all you're ever gonna be is mean yeah
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
someday i'll be living in a big old city
why you gotta be so mean?
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
someday i'll be big enough so you can't hit me
why you gotta be so mean?
and all you're ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean?
i used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
how we met and the sparks flew instantly
and people would say they're the lucky ones
i used to know my place was a spot next to you
now i'm searching the room for an empty seat
'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on
oh a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fallout
so many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up i can't break through
now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know
is it killing you like it's killing me?
yeah i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
next chapter
how'd we end up this way?
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
and you're doing your best to avoid me
i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us
how i was losing my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride like you should've held me
oh i'm scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothing?
i'd tell you i miss you but i don't know how
i've never heard silence quite this loud
now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know
is it killing you like it's killing me?
yeah and i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
this is looking like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but i liked it better when you were on my side
the battle's in your hands now
but i would lay my armor down
if you say you'd rather love than fight
so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon
now i'm standing alone in a crowded room
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know
is it killing you like it's killing me?
yeah and i don't know what to say
since the twist of fate when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now
and we're not speaking
and i'm dying to know
is it killing you like it's killing me yeah?
i don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'cause we're going down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
the end
your little hand's wrapped around my finger
and it's so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
so i tuck you in turn on your favorite night light
to you everything's funny you got nothing to regret
i'd give all i have honey
if you could stay like that
oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up it could stay this simple
i won't let nobody hurt you won't let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up never grow up
you're in the car on the way to the movies
and you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
at fourteen there's just so much you can't do
and you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
but don't make her drop you off around the block
remember that she's getting older too
and don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up it could stay this simple
no one's ever burned you nothing's ever left you scarred
and even though you want to just try to never grow up
take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is someday gonna be gone
so here i am in my new apartment
in a big city they just dropped me off
it's so much colder than i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my night light on
wish i'd never grown up
i wish i'd never grown up
oh i don't wanna grow up wish i'd never grown up
i could still be little
oh i don't wanna grow up wish i'd never grown up
it could still be simple
oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darling don't you ever grow up
don't you ever grow up it could stay this simple
won't let nobody hurt you
won't let no one break your heart
and even though you want to please try to never grow up
oh don't you ever grow up
oh never grow up just never grow up
there i was again tonight
forcing laughter faking smiles
same old tired lonely place
walls of insincerity shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is it was enchanting to meet you
your eyes whispered have we met?
'cross the room your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was enchanting to meet you
all i can say is i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever
wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
the lingering question kept me up
2am who do you love?
i wonder 'til i'm wide awake
and now i'm pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i'd open up and you would say hey
it was enchanting to meet you
all i know is i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever
wondering if you knew
this night is flawless
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever
wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
this is me praying that
this was the very first page
not where the storyline ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love
with someone else
please don't have somebody
waiting on you
please don't be in love ooh
with someone else
please don't have somebody ooh hey
waiting on you
this night is sparkling
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i'll spend forever
wondering if you knew
this night is flawless please don't be in love with someone else
don't you let it go
i'm wonderstruck please don't have somebody waiting on you
dancing around all alone
i'll spend forever please don't be in love with someone else
wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
please don't be in love
with someone else
please don't have somebody
waiting on you
now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
ha time for a little revenge
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
i had it all i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along got him alone and let's hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
i never saw it coming wouldn't have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
she underestimated just who she was stealing from
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress whoa
he was a moth to the flame
she was holding the matches
soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge ha
she looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
she looks at me like i'm a trend and she's so over it
i think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
and she thinks i'm psycho 'cause i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
oh they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
think about what you did
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress whoa
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress whoa
soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge ha
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him but haven't you heard?
i'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
you might have him but i always get the last word
whoa whoa-ah-oh
she's not a saint and she's not what you think
she's an actress whoa she deserved it
she's better known for the things that she does
on the mattress whoa
soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground won't make you many friends
she should keep in mind she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge ha

she took him faster than you could say sabotage
i guess you really did it this time
left yourself in your war path
lost your balance on a tightrope
lost your mind trying to get it back
wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
always a bigger bed to crawl into
wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
and everybody believed in you?
it's alright just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent you're still an innocent
did some things you can't speak of
but at night you live it all again
you wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then
wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
when everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down to you
wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you?
it's alright just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent
time turns flames to embers
you'll have new septembers
every one of us has messed up too
lives change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new oh
it's alright just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh who you are is not where you've been
you're still an innocent
it's okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you're still an innocent you're still an innocent
lost your balance on a tightrope oh
it's never too late to get it back
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought i'd live to see it break
it's getting dark and it's all too quiet
and i can't trust anything now
and it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
whoa holding my breath
won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold
come on come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now i'm haunted
stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time i'm wishing it was you instead
oh holding my breath
won't see you again
something keeps me holding onto nothing
come on come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you're all i wanted
come on come on don't leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
can't breathe whenever you're gone
can't turn back now i'm haunted
i know

can't go back i'm haunted
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i'd see it break
never thought i'd see it
i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 1:58
the words that you whispered
for just us to know
you told me you loved me
so why did you go away?
away
i do recall now the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement
i ran off the plane
that july 9th
the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt
i can still feel your arms
but now i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party you're showing off again
and i roll my eyes and then
you pull me in
i'm not much for dancing
but for you i did
because i love your handshake meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you'd kiss me when i was in the middle of saying something
there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions
and i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
i never imagined we'd end like this
your name forever the name on my lips ooh
so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it's nice where you are
and i hope the sun shines
and it's a beautiful day
and something reminds you
you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind
so i'll go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i don't know how to be something you miss
i never thought we'd have a last kiss
never imagined we'd end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last
i said remember this moment in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in stands went wild
we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew our lives
would never be the same
you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age
long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
i said remember this feeling
i passed the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there
on the side-lines wishing for right now
we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town
and the cynics were outraged
screaming this is absurd
'cause for a moment a band of thieves
in ripped up jeans got to rule the world
long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid
long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
i was screaming long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall
will you take a moment?
promise me this
that you'll stand by me forever
but if god forbid fate should step in
and force us into a goodbye
if you have children some day
when they point to the pictures
please tell them my name
tell them how the crowds went wild
tell them how i hope they shine
long live the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life with you
long long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i'm not afraid
singing long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
and long long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
elevator buttons and morning air
strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
but right now my time is theirs
seems like there's always someone who disapproves
they'll judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jury's out but my choice is you
so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high the water's rough
but this love is ours
you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i don't care 'cause right now you're mine
and you'll say
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high the water's rough
but this love is ours
and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
and i'll fight their doubt and give you faith
with this song for you
'cause i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
will be ignored
'cause my heart is yours
so don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
don't you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they can't take what's ours
they can't take what's ours
the stakes are high the water's rough
but this love is ours
last night i heard my own heart beating
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and i'm still reaching
even though i know you're not there
i was playing back a thousand memories baby
thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
maybe i've been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside till i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now
i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'cause nothing like this ever happened to them
now i'm pacing down the hall chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me
nothing's gonna change not for me and you
not before i knew how much i had to lose
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside till i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now
if you're out there if you're somewhere if you're moving on
i've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
i just want it back the way it was before
and i just want to see you back at my front door
and i say come back come back come back to me like
you would before you said it's not that easy
before the fight before i locked you out
but i take it all back now
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside till i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said you're sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you'd be here by now
you'd be here by now
it's not the kind of ending you want to see now
baby what about the ending?
oh i thought you'd be here by now
thought you'd be here by now
tall dark and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
it's the same thing to me
he's got his mother's eyes his father's ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say yay
and you smile and say how are you?
i say just fine
i always forget to tell you i love you
i love you forever
i watch superman fly away
you've got a busy day today
go save the world i'll be around
i watch superman fly away
come back i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down
tall dark and beautiful
he's complicated he's irrational
but i hope someday you'll take me away and save the day yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
he's not all bad like his reputation
and i can't hear one single word they say
and you'll leave got places to be and i'll be okay

and i hope you don't save some other girl
don't forget don't forget about me
i'm far away but i never let you go
i'm love-struck and looking out the window

right here wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the call was from you
'cause i loved you from the very first day
i watch superman fly away

forever and ever here
i watch superman fly away
i swear i'll be with you someday
i'll be right here on the ground
when you come back down
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
when you come back down? i'm walking fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
or fades in time
and i never never
saw you coming
and i'll never never
be the same
you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannonball
now all we know is don't let go
we are alone just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs four blue eyes
so you were never a saint
and i've loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild
and i never never
saw you coming
and i'll never never
be the same
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
you're my achilles heel
this is the golden age
of something good and right and real
and i never never
saw you coming
and i'll never
be the same
and i never never
saw you coming
and i'll never so you were never a saint
and i've loved in shades of wrong
be the same we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
loving him is like
driving a new maserati down a dead-end street
faster than the wind passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind
once you're already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn so bright
just before they lose it all
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray all alone
forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
red red
red red
loving him was red
red red
red red
touching him was like
realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as
easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like
trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like
wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray all alone whoa
forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
red red
oh red red red
burning red red red
red red
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
burning it was red
oh losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark gray all alone whoa
forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you never met
'cause loving him was red
red red yeah yeah red red red
burning red red red
red red
and that's why red red he's spinning 'round in my head
comes back to me red red burning red
red red yeah yeah
red red
his love was like
driving a new maserati down a dead-end street
put your lips close to mine
as long as they don't touch
out of focus eye to eye
'til the gravity's too much
and i'll do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and i'd be smart to walk away
but you're quicksand
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i-i-i like it
i can't decide if it's a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow
but you're friction
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
i i i like it
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
i-i-i i-i-i i-i-i
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
this slope is treacherous
i-i-i like it
once upon a time a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights you got me alone
you found me you found me you found me
i guess you didn't care and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard you took a step back
without me without me without me
and he's long gone when he's next to me
and i realize the blame is on me
'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh oh-oh
trouble trouble trouble
oh oh-oh
trouble trouble trouble
no apologies he'll never see you cry
pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
you're drowning you're drowning you're drowning
and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
and now i see now i see now i see
he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me hey
i knew you were trouble when you walked in oh
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been yeah
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh oh-oh yeah
trouble trouble trouble
oh oh-oh
trouble trouble trouble
and the saddest fear
comes creeping in
that you never loved me
or her or anyone or anything
yeah
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i'd never been never been
'til you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in knew it right there
so shame on me now knew it right there
flew me to places i'd never been ooh
now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
oh oh-oh
trouble trouble trouble oh
oh oh-oh
trouble trouble trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble trouble trouble
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble trouble trouble
i walked through the door with you the air was cold
but something 'bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you've still got it in your drawer even now
oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
we're singing in the car getting lost upstate
autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know it's long gone and
that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay but i'm not fine at all
oh oh oh
'cause there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
wind in my hair i was there
i remember it all too well
photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
you tell me 'bout your past thinking your future was me
and i know it's long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough
to forget why i needed to
'cause there we are again in the middle of the night
we're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs i was there
i remember it all too well yeah
maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'til you tore it all up
running scared i was there
i remember it all too well
and you call me up again
just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'cause i remember it all all all
too well
time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it
i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you can't get rid of it
'cause you remember it all too well yeah
'cause there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
it was rare i was there
i remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare i was there
i remember it all too well
it feels like a perfect night
to dress up like hipsters
and make fun of our exes uh-uh uh-uh
it feels like a perfect night
for breakfast at midnight
to fall in love with strangers uh-uh uh-uh

i threw my phone across the room at you
i was expecting some dramatic turn away
but you stayed
this morning i said we should talk about it
'cause i read you should never leave a fight unresolved
that's when you came in wearing a football helmet
and said okay let's talk
and i said
stay stay stay
i've been loving you for quite some time time time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad mad mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay
before you i'd only dated self-indulgent takers
who took all of their problems out on me
but you carry my groceries and now i'm always laughing
and i love you because you have given me
no choice but to
stay stay stay
i've been loving you for quite some time time time
you think that it's funny when i'm mad mad mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay stay stay stay
you took the time to memorize me
my fears my hopes and dreams
i just like hanging out with you all the time
all those times that you didn't leave it's been occurring to me
i'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
stay and i'll be loving you for quite some time
no one else is gonna love me when i get mad mad mad
so i think that it's best if we both stay stay
stay stay stay stay!

you think that it's funny when i'm mad mad mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay stay

you think that it's funny when i'm mad mad mad
but i think that it's best if we both stay
ha-ha-ha it's so fun
find myself at your door
just like all those times before
i'm not sure how i got there
all roads they lead me here
i imagine you are home
in your room all alone
and you open your eyes into mine
and everything feels better
and right before your eyes
i'm breaking no past
no reasons why
just you and me
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye
you find yourself at my door
just like all those times before
you wear your best apology
but i was there to watch you leave
and all the times i let you in
just for you to go again
disappear when you come back
everything is better
and right before your eyes
i'm aching run fast
nowhere to hide
just you and me
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why
you break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye
this is the last time you tell me i've got it wrong
this is the last time i say it's been you all along
this is the last time i let you in my door
this is the last time i won't hurt you anymore
oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho
oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho
this is the last time i'm asking you this
put my name at the top of your list
this is the last time i'm asking you why

last time i'm asking you this
i was reminiscing just the other day
while having coffee all alone and lord it took me away
back to a first-glance feeling on new york time
back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light go
hey you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
and that was the first day
and darling it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground
spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big wide city all to ourselves
we blocked the noise with the sound of i need you
and for the first time i had something to lose
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the story's got dust on every page
but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd
'cause darling it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground
tonight i'm gonna dance
for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
tonight i'm gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
it was good
never looking down
and right there where we stood
was holy ground
tonight i'm gonna dance
for all that we've been through
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
tonight i'm gonna dance
like you were in this room
but i don't wanna dance
if i'm not dancing with you
long handwritten note deep in your pocket
words how little they mean when you're a little too late
i stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
good girls hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
we had a beautiful magic love affair
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
in dreams i meet you in warm conversation
we both wake in lonely beds different cities
and time is taking its sweet time erasing you
and you've got your demons
and darling they all look like me
'cause we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
distance timing breakdown fighting
silence the train runs off its tracks
kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen?
hang up give up and for the life of us we can't get back
a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful
what we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
new to town with a made up name
in the angel's city chasing fortune and fame
and the camera flashes make it look like a dream
you had it figured out since you were in school
everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
so overnight you look like a sixties queen
another name goes up in lights
like diamonds in the sky
and they'll tell you now you're the lucky one
yeah they'll tell you now you're the lucky one
but can you tell me now you're the lucky one?
oh oh oh
now it's big black cars and riviera views
and your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
and they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
'cause you don't feel pretty you just feel used
and all the young things line up to take your place
another name goes up in lights
you wonder if you'll make it out alive
and they'll tell you now you're the lucky one
yeah they'll tell you now you're the lucky one
but can you tell me now you're the lucky one?
oh oh oh
it was a few years later i showed up here
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
how you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
chose the rose garden over madison square
and it took some time but i understand it now
'cause now my name is up in lights
but i think you got it right
let me tell you now you're the lucky one
let me tell you now you're the lucky one
let me tell you now you're the lucky one oh oh oh
and they'll tell you now you're the lucky one
yeah they'll tell you now you're the lucky one
and they'll tell you now you're the lucky one oh oh oh
oh whoa oh oh
all i knew this morning when i woke
is i know something now
know something now i didn't before
and all i've seen since 18 hours ago
is green eyes and freckles and your smile
in the back of my mind making me feel like
i just wanna know you better
know you better know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better know you better now
i just wanna know you know you know you
'cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home
all i know is a simple name
everything has changed
all i know is you held the door
you'll be mine and i'll be yours
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed
and all my walls stood tall painted blue
and i'll take 'em down take 'em down
and open up the door for you
and all i feel in my stomach is butterflies
the beautiful kind making up for lost time
taking flight making me feel right
i just wanna know you better
know you better know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better know you better now
i just wanna know you better
know you better know you better now

and meet me there tonight
and let me know that it's not all in my mind
i just wanna know you better

i just wanna know you know you know you
'cause all i know is we said hello
and your eyes look like coming home

so dust off your highest hopes
all i know is pouring rain
and everything has changed
all i know is a new found grace
all my days i'll know your face
all i know since yesterday
is everything has changed
i said oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like we're made of starlight
like we're made of starlight
i met bobby on the boardwalk summer of '45
picked me up late one night at the window
we were 17 and crazy running wild wild
can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
the night we snuck into a yacht club party
pretending to be a duchess and a prince
and i said oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like we're made of starlight starlight
like we're made of starlight starlight
he said look at you
worrying so much about things you can't change
you'll spend your whole life singing the blues
if you keep thinking that way
he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
don't you see the starlight starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?
like oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like we're made of starlight starlight
like we're made of starlight starlight
ooh ooh he's talking crazy
ooh ooh dancing with me
ooh ooh we could get married
have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like we're made of starlight starlight
like we're made of starlight starlight
like we're made of starlight starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
like starlight starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
don't you see the starlight starlight?
don't you dream impossible things?
took a deep breath in the mirror
he didn't like it when i wore high heels but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he didn't get this song but i do i do
walked in expecting you'd be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you don't know how nice that is but i do
and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
you said you never met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you but i do
we tell stories and you don't know why
i'm coming off a little shy but i do
but you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
and we walked down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches every single christmas
and i want to talk about that
and for the first time what's past is past
'cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it's strange that you think i'm funny 'cause he never did
i've been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
you should've been there
should've burst through the door
with that baby i'm right here smile
and it would've felt like
a million little shining stars had just aligned
and i would've been so happy
christmas lights glisten
i've got my eye on the door
just waiting for you to walk in
but the time is ticking
people ask me how i've been
as i comb back through my memory
how you said you'd be here
you said you'd be here
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all laughing
as i'm looking around the room
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
and the hours pass by
now i just wanna be alone
but your close friends always seem to know
when there's something really wrong
so they follow me down the hall
and there in the bathroom
i try not to fall apart
and the sinking feeling starts
as i say hopelessly
he said he'd be here
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all laughing
and asking me about you
but there was one thing missing missing
and that was the moment i knew
what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know?
and what do you do
when the one who means the most to you
is the one who didn't show?
you should've been here
and i would've been so happy
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they're all standing around me singing
happy birthday to you
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh i knew
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
you called me later
and said i'm sorry i didn't make it
and i said i'm sorry too
and that was the moment i knew
you said it in a simple way
4 am the second day
how strange that i don't know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall
i told myself don't get attached
but in my mind i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you
and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess you're in new york today
i don't wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
the delicate beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i know now
i never would've played so nonchalant
taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i can't help but wish you took me with you
and this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess you're in london today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you when you are worlds away
in new york be here
but you're in london and i break down
'cause it's not fair that you're not around
this is when the feeling sinks in
i don't wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess you're in new york today
and i don't wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
oh-oh oh-oh
i don't wanna miss you like this
oh-oh oh-oh
come back be here
come back be here
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that ah-ah
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that
i don't even know her
but i feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
it's kinda like a code yeah
and you've been getting closer and closer
and crossing so many lines
and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
but honey i am no one's exception
this i have previously learned
so don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that ah-ah
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
and now you've got me alone and i say
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i just want to make sure
you understand perfectly
you're the kind of man who makes me sad
while she waits up you chase down the newest thing
and take for granted what you have
and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
and yeah i might go with it
if i hadn't once been just like her
so don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that ah-ah
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
and now you've got me alone and i say
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
call a cab lose my number
you're about to lose your girl
call a cab lose my number
let's consider this lesson learned
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that ah-ah
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
want to see you pick up your phone
and tell her you're coming home
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
don't look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
it would be a fine proposition
if i hadn't once been just like her
put your lips close to mine
as long as they don't touch
out of focus eye to eye
till the gravity's too much
and i'll do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and i'd be smart to walk away
but you're quicksand
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i i i like it
i can't decide if it's a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone
trained to get along
forever going with the flow
but you're friction
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
i i i like it
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should
think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
i i i
i i i
i i i
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should
think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i would follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
i'll follow you follow you home
this slope is treacherous
i i i like it
loving him is like
driving a new maserati down a dead end street
faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
loving him is like
trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
like the colors in autumn
so bright just before they lose it all
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
but loving him was red
loving him was red
touching him was like
realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as
easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like
trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
regretting him was like
wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
but loving him was red
oh red
burning red
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it's time now gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
burning it was red
losing him was blue like i'd never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'cause loving him was red
yeah yeah red
we're burning red
and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
burning red burning red
his love was like
driving a new maserati down a dead end street
i'm walking fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannon ball
now all we know is don't let go
we are alone just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs four blue eyes
so you were never a saint
and i've loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild
and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
you're my achilles heel
this is the golden age of something good
and right and real
and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
and i never saw you coming
and i'll never be the same
this is a state of grace
this is a worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right? walking through a crowd the village is aglow
kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
everybody here wanted something more
searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
and it said
welcome to new york it's been waiting for you
welcome to new york welcome to new york
welcome to new york it's been waiting for you
welcome to new york welcome to new york
it's a new soundtrack i could dance to this beat beat forevermore
the lights are so bright but they never blind me me
welcome to new york it's been waiting for you
welcome to new york welcome to new york
when we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
took our broken hearts put them in a drawer
everybody here was someone else before
and you can want who you want
boys and boys and girls and girls
welcome to new york it's been waiting for you
welcome to new york welcome to new york
welcome to new york it's been waiting for you

it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
it's a bad sign bad sign
something happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circling dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame it could burn out
it could burn out
'cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns
they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run
baby i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'cause i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places
lights flash and we'll run for the fences
let them say what they want we won't hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time
just grab my hand and don't ever drop it my love
they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run
baby i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'cause i i know places we can hide
i know places
they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run
just grab my hand and don't ever drop it my love
baby i know places we won't be found
and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'cause i i know places we can hide
i know places
they take their shots but we're bulletproof i know places
and you know for me it's always you i know places
in the dead of night your eyes so green i know places
and i know for you it's always me i know places
i i i i i i i i-i
i i i i i i i i-i
the drought was the very worst oh-oh oh-oh
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of back and forth oh-oh oh-oh
you're still all over me
like a wine-stained dress i can't wear anymore
hung my head as i lost the war
and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning
gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean
oh oh oh oh
there was nothing left to do oh-oh oh-oh
when the butterflies turned to
dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof oh-oh oh-oh
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
the water filled my lungs i screamed so loud
but no one heard a thing
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning
gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean
oh oh oh oh
i think i am finally clean
oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh-oh
said i think i am finally clean
oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh-oh
ten months sober i must admit
just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
ten months older i won't give in
now that i'm clean i'm never gonna risk it
the drought was the very worst oh-oh oh-oh
when the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
oh
the rain came pouring down
when i was drowning that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning
gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning that's when i could finally breathe
and by morning
gone was any trace of you i think i am finally clean
oh oh
finally clean
think i'm finally clean
oh oh
oh-oh oh-oh
oh oh oh
think i'm finally clean
flashing lights and we
took a wrong turn and we
fell down a rabbit hole
you held on tight to me
'cause nothing's as it seems
and spinning out of control
didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twistin' around me
i should have slept with one eye open at night
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever eh eh
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better eh eh
eh eh eh eh eh
in wonderland
eh eh eh eh eh
in wonderland
eh eh eh eh eh
in wonderland
eh eh eh eh eh
in wonderland
so we went on our way
too in love to think straight
all alone or so it seemed
but there were strangers watching
and whispers turned to talking
and talking turned to screams oh
didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
didn't you calm my fears with a cheshire cat smile?
ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting?
i felt your arms twistin' around me
it's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
but darlin'
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever eh eh
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better eh eh
eh eh eh eh eh
in wonderland
eh eh eh eh eh
in wonderland
eh eh eh eh eh
in wonderland
eh eh eh eh eh
whoa in wonderland
i reached for you but you were gone
i knew i had to go back home
you searched the world for something else
to make you feel like what we had
and in the end in wonderland
we both went mad
oh
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever
last forever eh eh
we found wonderland
you and i got lost in it got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better

and life was never worse but never better
in wonderland
one look dark room
meant just for you
time moved too fast you play it back
buttons on a coat lighthearted joke
no proof not much but you saw enough
small talk he drives
coffee at midnight
the light reflects the chain on your neck
he says look up
and your shoulders brush
no proof one touch but you felt enough
you can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love
morning his place
burnt toast sunday
you keep his shirt he keeps his word
and for once you let go
of your fears and your ghosts
one step not much but it said enough
you kiss on sidewalks
you fight and you talk
one night he wakes
strange look on his face
pauses then says you're my best friend
and you knew what it was he is in love
you can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
you are in love true love
and so it goes
you two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now
why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
'cause you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love
you can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love
you can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love
we're all bored we're all so tired of everything
we wait for trains that just aren't coming
we show off our different scarlet letters
trust me mine is better
we're so young but we're on the road to ruin
we play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
honey life is just a classroom
ah ah ah ah ah ah
'cause baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
baby we're the new romantics
come on come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly

our secret moments in a crowded room
they got no idea about me and you
there is an indentation in the shape of you
made your mark on me a golden tattoo
all of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
my hands are shaking from holding back from you
ha ah ah
all of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
my hands are shaking from all this
ah ha ha ha-ah
say my name and everything just stops

inescapable i'm not even gonna try
and if i get burned at least we were electrified
i'm spilling wine in the bathtub

my hands are shaking from holding back from you

it was so nice throwing big parties
jump into the pool from the balcony
everyone swimming in a champagne sea
and there are no rules when you show up here
bass beat rattling the chandelier
feeling so gatsby for that whole year
so why'd you have to rain on my parade?
i'm shaking my head and locking the gates
this is why we can't have nice things darling
because you break them
i had to take them away
this is why we can't have nice things honey oh
did you think i wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
this is why we can't have nice things
it was so nice being friends again
there i was giving you a second chance
but you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
and therein lies the issue
friends don't try to trick you
get you on the phone and mind-twist you
and so i took an axe to a mended fence
but i'm not the only friend you've lost lately mm-mm
if only you weren't so shady
this is why we can't have nice things darling yeah
because you break them

and here's to my mama
had to listen to all this drama
and here's to you
'cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
haha i can't even say it with a straight face
this is why we can't have nice things darling darling
because you break them
i had to take them away
this is why we can't have nice uh-uh things oh no honey baby oh
did you think i wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?

this is why we can't have nice things
my castle crumbled overnight
i brought a knife to a gunfight
they took the crown but it's alright
all the liars are calling me one
nobody's heard from me for months

and i know i make the same mistakes every time
bridges burn i never learn

chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts
i dress to kill my time i take the long way home
i ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
they say i don't know
and what once was ours is no one's now
i see you everywhere the only thing we share
is this small town
you said it was a great love one for the ages
but if the story's over why am i still writing pages?
'cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
flashbacks waking me up
i get drunk but it's not enough
'cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts
my heart my hips my body my love
tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
gave up on me like i was a bad drug
now i'm searching for signs in a haunted club
our songs our films united we stand
our country guess it was a lawless land
quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
my time my wine my spirit my trust
tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
gave you so much but it wasn't enough
but i'll be alright it's just a thousand cuts
i get drunk but it's not enough
'cause you're not my baby
i look through the windows of this love
even though we boarded them up
chandelier's still flickering here
'cause i can't pretend it's okay when it's not
no it's not
it's death by a thousand cuts you didn't touch
tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
my body my love my trust it's death by a thousand cuts

my love was as cruel as the cities i lived in
everyone looked worse in the light
there are so many lines that i've crossed unforgiven
i'll tell you the truth but never goodbye
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
i've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
and now i see daylight i only see daylight
luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
and so i became the butt of the joke
i wounded the good and i trusted the wicked
clearing the air i breathed in the smoke
maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
maybe i've stormed out of every single room in this town
threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
it's brighter now now
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i can never look away
i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
things will never be the same
i've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
now i'm wide awake
and now i see daylight daylight i only see daylight daylight
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
and i can still see it all in my mind
all of you all of me intertwined
i once believed love would be black and white
but it's golden golden
and i can still see it all in my head
back and forth from new york sneaking in your bed
i once believed love would be burning red
but it's golden
like daylight like daylight
like daylight daylight
i don't wanna look at anything else now that i saw you
i can never look away
and i don't wanna think of anything else now that i thought of you
things will never be the same
i've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
now i'm wide awake
and now i see daylight i see daylight i only see daylight ah
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight ah
and i can still see it all
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
and i can still see it all back and forth from new york
i only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
i once believed love would be burning red
like daylight
it's golden like daylight
you gotta step into the daylight and let it go
just let it go let it go
i wanna be defined by the things that i love
not the things i hate
not the things i'm afraid of i'm afraid of
or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
i i just think that
you are what you love i'm doing good i'm on some new shit
been saying yes instead of no
i thought i saw you at the bus stop i didn't though
i hit the ground running each night
i hit the sunday matinee
you know the greatest films of all time were never made
i guess you never know never know
and if you wanted me you really should've showed
and if you never bleed you're never gonna grow
and it's alright now
but we were something don't you think so?
roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
and if my wishes came true
it would've been you
in my defense i have none
for never leaving well enough alone
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
ooh
i have this dream you're doing cool shit
having adventures on your own
you meet some woman on the internet and take her home
we never painted by the numbers baby
but we were making it count
you know the greatest loves of all time are over now
i guess you never know never know
and it's another day waking up alone
but we were something don't you think so?
roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
and if my wishes came true
it would've been you
in my defense i have none
for never leaving well enough alone
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
i i i persist and resist the temptation to ask you
if one thing had been different
would everything be different today?
we were something don't you think so?
rose flowing with your chosen family
and it would've been sweet
if it could've been me
in my defense i have none
for digging up the grave another time
but it would've been fun
if you would've been the one
ooh
vintage tee brand new phone
high heels on cobblestones
when you are young they assume you know nothing
sequin smile black lipstick
sensual politics
when you are young they assume you know nothing
but i knew you
dancin' in your levi's
drunk under a streetlight i
i knew you
hand under my sweatshirt
baby kiss it better i
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite
a friend to all is a friend to none
chase two girls lose the one
when you are young they assume you know nothing
but i knew you
playing hide-and-seek and
giving me your weekends i
i knew you
your heartbeat on the high line
once in twenty lifetimes i
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite
to kiss in cars and downtown bars
was all we needed
you drew stars around my scars
but now i'm bleedin'
'cause i knew you
steppin' on the last train
marked me like a bloodstain i
i knew you
tried to change the ending
peter losing wendy i
i knew you
leavin' like a father
running like water i
and when you are young they assume you know nothing
but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
i knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
the smell of smoke would hang around this long
'cause i knew everything when i was young
i knew i'd curse you for the longest time
chasin' shadows in the grocery line
i knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
and you'd be standin' in my front porch light
and i knew you'd come back to me
you'd come back to me
and you'd come back to me
and you'd come back
and when i felt like i was an old cardigan
under someone's bed
you put me on and said i was your favorite
rebekah rode up on the afternoon train it was sunny
her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off st. louis
bill was the heir to the standard oil name and money
and the town said how did a middle-class divorcee do it?
the wedding was charming if a little gauche
there's only so far new money goes
they picked out a home and called it holiday house
their parties were tasteful if a little loud
the doctor had told him to settle down
it must have been her fault his heart gave out
and they said
there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows if she never showed up what could've been
there goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything
rebekah gave up on the rhode island set forever
flew in all her bitch pack friends from the city
filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
and blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
and losing on card game bets with dali
and they said
there goes the last great american dynasty
who knows if she never showed up what could've been
there goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
she had a marvelous time ruining everything
they say she was seen on occasion
pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
and in a feud with her neighbor
she stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
fifty years is a long time
holiday house sat quietly on that beach
free of women with madness their men and bad habits
and then it was bought by me
who knows if i never showed up what could've been
there goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
i had a marvelous time ruining everything
i had a marvelous time ruining everything
a marvelous time ruining everything
a marvelous time
i had a marvelous time
i can see you standing honey
with his arms around your body
laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
and it took you five whole minutes
to pack us up and leave me with it
holdin' all this love out here in the hall
i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
you're not my homeland anymore
so what am i defending now?
you were my town now i'm in exile seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before
ooh ooh ooh
i can see you starin' honey
like he's just your understudy
like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
second third and hundredth chances
balancin' on breaking branches
those eyes add insult to injury
i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
i'm not your problem anymore
so who am i offending now?
you were my crown now i'm in exile seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before
so i'm leaving out the side door
so step right out there is no amount
of crying i can do for you
all this time
we always walked a very thin line
you didn't even hear me out you didn't even hear me out
you never gave a warning sign i gave so many signs
all this time
i never learned to read your mind never learned to read my mind
i couldn't turn things around you never turned things around
'cause you never gave a warning sign i gave so many signs
so many signs so many signs
you didn't even see the signs
i think i've seen this film before
and i didn't like the ending
you're not my homeland anymore
so what am i defending now?
you were my town now i'm in exile seein' you out
i think i've seen this film before
so i'm leavin' out the side door
so step right out there is no amount
of crying i can do for you
all this time
we always walked a very thin line
you didn't even hear me out didn't even hear me out
you never gave a warning sign i gave so many signs
all this time
i never learned to read your mind never learned to read my mind
i couldn't turn things around you never turned things around
'cause you never gave a warning sign i gave so many signs
you never gave a warning sign all this time
so many times i never learned to read your mind
so many signs i couldn't turn things around i couldn't turn things around
'cause you never gave a warning sign you never gave a warning sign
you never gave a warning sign
ah ah
we gather here we line up weepin' in a sunlit room
and if i'm on fire you'll be made of ashes too
even on my worst day did i deserve babe
all the hell you gave me?
'cause i loved you i swear i loved you
'til my dying day
i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and you're the hero flying around saving face
and if i'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
cursing my name wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet
we gather stonesnever knowing what they'll mean
some to throw some to make a diamond ring
you know i didn't want to have to haunt you
but what a ghostly scene
you wear the same jewels that i gave you
as you bury me
i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'cause when i'd fight you used to tell me i was brave
and if i'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
cursing my name wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet
and i can go anywhere i want
anywhere i want just not home
and you can aim for my heart go for blood
but you would still miss me in your bones
and i still talk to you when i'm screaming at the sky
and when you can't sleep at night you hear my stolen lullabies
i didn't have it in myself to go with grace
and so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
you had to kill me but it killed you just the same
cursing my name wishing i stayed
you turned into your worst fears
and you're tossing out blame drunk on this pain
crossing out the good years
and you're cursing my name wishing i stayed
look at how my tears ricochet
i want you to know
i'm a mirrorball
i'll show you every version of yourself tonight
i'll get you out on the floor
shimmering beautiful
and when i break it's in a million pieces
hush when no one is around my dear
you'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
spinning in my highest heels love
shining just for you
hush i know they said the end is near
but i'm still on my tallest tiptoes
spinning in my highest heels love
shining just for you
i want you to know
i'm a mirrorball
i can change everything about me to fit in
you are not like the regulars
the masquerade revelers
drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
hush when no one is around my dear
you'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
spinning in my highest heels love
shining just for you
hush i know they said the end is near
but i'm still on my tallest tiptoes
spinning in my highest heels love
shining just for you
and they called off the circusburned the disco down
when they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
i'm still on that tightrope
i'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
and i'm still a believer but i don't know why
i've never been a natural all i do is try try try
i'm still on that trapeze
i'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me
because i'm a mirrorball
i'm a mirrorball
and i'll show you every version of yourself tonight
please picture me in the trees
i hit my peak at seven
feet in the swing over the creek
i was too scared to jump in
but i i was high in the sky
with pennsylvania under me
are there still beautiful things?
sweet tea in the summer
cross your heart won't tell no other
and though i can't recall your face
i still got love for you
your braids like a pattern
love you to the moon and to saturn
passed down like folk songs
the love lasts so long
and i've been meaning to tell you
i think your house is haunted
your dad is always mad and that must be why
and i think you should come live with me
and we can be pirates
then you won't have to cry
or hide in the closet
and just like a folk song
our love will be passed on
please picture me in the weeds
before i learned civility
i used to scream ferociously
any time i wanted
i i
sweet tea in the summer
cross my heart won't tell no other
and though i can't recall your face
i still got love for you
pack your dolls and a sweater
we'll move to india forever
passed down like folk songs
our love lasts so long
salt air and the rust on your door
i never needed anything more
whispers of are you sure?
never have i ever before
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine
your back beneath the sun
wishin' i could write my name on it
will you call when you're back at school?
i remember thinkin' i had you
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine
back when we were still changin' for the better
wanting was enough
for me it was enough
to live for the hope of it all
cancel plans just in case you'd call
and say meet me behind the mall
so much for summer love and saying us
'cause you weren't mine to lose
you weren't mine to lose no
but i can see us lost in the memory
august slipped away into a moment in time
'cause it was never mine
and i can see us twisted in bedsheets
august sipped away like a bottle of wine
'cause you were never mine
'cause you were never mine
never mine
but do you remember?
remember when i pulled up and said get in the car
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
meet me behind the mall
remember when i pulled up and said get in the car
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
meet me behind the mall
remember when i pulled up and said get in the car
and then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
back when i was livin' for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
i've been having a hard time adjusting
i had the shiniest wheels now they're rusting
i didn't know if you'd care if i came back
i have a lot of regrets about that
pulled the car off the road to the lookout
could've followed my fears all the way down
and maybe i don't quite know what to say
but i'm here in your doorway
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
they told me all of my cages were mental
so i got wasted like all my potential
and my words shoot to kill when i'm mad
i have a lot of regrets about that
i was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere
fell behind all my classmates and i ended up here
pouring out my heart to a stranger
but i didn't pour the whiskey
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
at least i'm trying
and it's hard to be at a party when i feel like an open wound
it's hard to be anywhere these days when all i want is you
you're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
and i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
and maybe i don't quite know what to say
i just wanted you to know that this is me trying
at least i'm trying
make sure nobody sees you leave
hood over your head keep your eyes down
tell your friends you're out for a run
you'll be flushed when you return
take the road less traveled by
tell yourself you can always stop
what started in beautiful rooms
ends with meetings in parking lots
and that's the thing about illicit affairs
and clandestine meetings and longing stares
it's born from just one single glance
but it dies and it dies and it dies
a million little times
leave the perfume on the shelf
that you picked out just for him
so you leave no trace behind
like you don't even exist
take the words for what they are
a dwindling mercurial high
a drug that only worked
the first few hundred times
and that's the thing about illicit affairs
and clandestine meetings and stolen stares
they show their truth one single time
but they lie and they lie and they lie
a million little times
and you wanna scream
don't call me kid don't call me baby
look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
you showed me colors you know i can't see with anyone else
don't call me kid don't call me baby
look at this idiotic fool that you made me
you taught me a secret language i can't speak with anyone else
and you know damn well
for you i would ruin myself
a million little times
green was the color of the grass
where i used to read at centennial park
i used to think i would meet somebody there
teal was the color of your shirt
when you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
you used to work at to make a little money
time curious time
gave me no compasses gave me no signs
were there clues i didn't see?
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
bad was the blood of the song in the cab
on your first trip to la
you ate at my favorite spot for dinner
bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
getting lunch down by the lakes
she said i looked like an american singer
time mystical time
cutting me open then healing me fine
were there clues i didn't see?
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
a string that pulled me
out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
chains around my demons
wool to brave the seasons
one single thread of gold
tied me to you
cold was the steel of my axe to grind
for the boys who broke my heart
now i send their babies presents
gold was the color of the leaves
when i showed you around centennial park
hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
time wondrous time
gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
and it's cool
baby with me
and isn't it just so pretty to think
all along there was some
invisible string
tying you to me?
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
me
ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
ah-ah-ah
ah-ah-ah
what did you think i'd say to that?
does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
they strike to kill and you know i will
you know i will
what do you sing on your drive home?
do you see my?face?in?the neighbor's lawn?
does?she smile?
or does?she mouth fuck you forever?
every time you call me crazy i get more crazy
what about that?
and when you say i seem angry i get more angry
and there's nothing like a mad woman
what a shame she went mad
no one likes a mad woman
you made her like that
and you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
and you find something to wrap your noose around
and there's nothing like a mad woman
now i breathe flames each time i talk
my cannons all firin' at your yacht
they say move on but you know i won't
and women like hunting witches too
doing your dirtiest work for you
it's obvious that wanting me dead
has really brought you two together
every time you call me crazy i get more crazy
what about that?
and when you say i seem angry i get more angry
and there's nothing like a mad woman
what a shame she went mad
no one likes a mad woman
you made her like that
and you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
and you find something to wrap your noose around
and there's nothing like a mad woman
i'm taking my time taking my time
'cause you took everything from me
watching you climb watching you climb
over people like me
the master of spin has a couple side flings
good wives always know
she should be mad should be scathing like me but
no one likes a mad woman
what a shame she went mad
you made her like that
keep your helmet keep your life son
just a flesh wound here's your rifle
crawling up the beaches now
sir i think he's bleeding out
and some things you just can't speak about
with you i serve with you i fall down down
watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out
something med school did not cover
someone's daughter someone's mother
holds your hand through plastic now
doc i think she's crashing out
and some things you just can't speak about
only twenty minutes to sleep
but you dream of some epiphany
just one single glimpse of relief
to make some sense of what you've seen
with you i serve with you i fall down down down
watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out
with you i serve with you i serve with you i fall down down down down
watch you breathe in watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out out out
only twenty minutes to sleep
but you dream of some epiphany
just one single glimpse of relief
to make some sense of what you've seen
betty i won't make assumptions
about why you switched your homeroom but
i think it's 'cause of me
betty one time i was riding on my skateboard
when i passed your house
it's like i couldn't breathe
you heard the rumors frominez
you can't believe a word she says
most times but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you
but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me? would you want me?
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden?
in the garden would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing?
i'm only seventeen i don't know anything
but i know i miss you
betty i know where it all went wrong
your favorite song was playing
from the far side of the gym
i was nowhere to be found
i hate the crowds you know that
plus i saw you dance with him
you heard the rumors from inez
you can't believe a word she says
most times but this time it was true
the worst thing that i ever did
was what i did to you
but if i just showed up at your party
would you have me? would you want me?
would you tell me to go fuck myself
or lead me to the garden?
in the garden would you trust me
if i told you it was just a summer thing?
i'm only seventeen i don't know anything
but i know i miss you
i was walking home on broken cobblestones
just thinking of you when she pulled up like
a figment of my worst intentions
she said james get in let's drive
those days turned into nights
slept next to her but
i dreamt of you all summer long
betty i'm here on your doorstep
and i planned it out for weeks now
but it's finally sinkin' in
betty right now is the last time
i can dream about what happens when
you see my face again
the only thing i wanna do
is make it up to you
so i showed up at your party
yeah i showed up at your party
yeah i showed up at your party
will you have me? will you love me?
will you kiss me on the porch
in front of all your stupid friends?
if you kiss me will it be just like i dreamed it?
will it patch your broken wings?
i'm only seventeen i don't know anything
but i know i miss you
standing in your cardigan
kissin' in my car again
stopped at a streetlight
you know i miss you
our coming-of-age has come and gone
suddenly this summer it's clear
i never had the courage of my convictions
as long as danger is near
and it's just around the corner darlin'
'cause it lives in me
no i could never give you peace
but i'm a fire and i'll keep your brittle heart warm
if your cascade ocean wave blues come
all these people think love's for show
but i would die for you in secret
the devil's in the details but you got a friend in me
would it be enough if i could never give you peace?
your integrity makes me seem small
you paint dreamscapes on the wall
i talk shit with my friends it's like i'm wasting your honor
and you know that i'd swing with you for the fences
sit with you in the trenches
give you my wild give you a child
give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
family that i chose now that i see your brother as my brother
is it enough?
but there's robbers to the east clowns to the west
i'd give you my sunshine give you my best
but the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
but i'm a fire and i'll keep your brittle heart warm
if your cascade ocean wave blues come
all these people think love's for show
but i would die for you in secret
the devil's in the details but you got a friend in me
would it be enough if i could never give you peace?
would it be enough if i could never give you peace?
would it be enough if i could never give you peace?
my only one
my smoking gun
my eclipsed sun
this has broken me down
my twisted knife
my sleepless night
my winless fight
this has frozen my ground
stood on the cliffside screaming give me a reason
your faithless love's the only hoax i believe in
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do
my best laid plan
your sleight of hand
my barren land
i am ash from your fire
stood on the cliffside screaming give me a reason
your faithless love's the only hoax i believe in
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do
you know i left a part of me back in new york
you knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart
you knew the password so i let you in the door
you knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
you knew it still hurts underneath my scars
from when they pulled me apart
but what you did was just as dark
ah ah ah
darling this was just as hard
as when they pulled me apart
my only one
my kingdom come undone
my broken drum
you have beaten my heart
don't want no other shade of blue but you
no other sadness in the world would do
is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
i'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
these hunters with cell phones
take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
i don't belong and my beloved neither do you
those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
i'm setting off but not without my muse
what should be over burrowed under my skin
in heart-stopping waves of hurt
i've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
tell me what are my words worth
take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
i don't belong and my beloved neither do you
those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
i'm setting off but not without my muse
i want auroras and sad prose
i want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'cause i haven't moved in years
and i want you right here
a red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
with no one around to tweet it
while i bathe in cliffside pools
with my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
i don't belong and my beloved neither do you
those windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
i'm setting off but not without my muse
no not without you
i'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
and if it was an open-shut case
i never would've known from that look on your face
lost in your current like a priceless wine
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans that's my man
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
head on the pillow i could feel you sneakin' in
as if you were a mythical thing
like you were a trophy or a champion ring
and there was one prize i'd cheat to win
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans that's my man
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
they count me out time and time again
life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
but i come back stronger than a '90s trend
wait for the signal and i'll meet you after dark
show me the places where the others gave you scars
now this is an open-shut case
i guess i should've known from the look on your face
every bait-and-switch was a work of art
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans that's my man
the more that you say the less i know
wherever you stray i follow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans that's my man
you know that my train could take you home
anywhere else is hollow
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans that's my man
hey that's my man
that's my man
yeah that's my man
every bait-and-switch was a work of art
that's my man
hey that's my man
i'm begging for you to take my hand
wreck my plans that's my man
you booked the night train for a reason
so you could sit there in this hurt
bustling crowds or silent sleepers
you're not sure which is worse
because i dropped your hand while dancing
left you out there standing
crestfallen on the landing
champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
my picture in your wallet
your heart was glass i dropped it
champagne problems
you told your family for a reason
you couldn't keep it in
your sister splashed out on the bottle
now no one's celebrating
dom perignon you brought it
no crowd of friends applauded
your hometown skeptics called it
champagne problems
you had a speech you're speechless
love slipped beyond your reaches
and i couldn't give a reason
champagne problems
your midas touch on the chevy door
november flush and your flannel cure
this dorm was once a madhouse
i made a joke well it's made for me
how evergreen our group of friends
don't think we'll say that word again
and soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
that we once walked through
one for the money two for the show
i never was ready so i watch you go
sometimes you just don't know the answer
'til someone's on their knees and asks you
she would've made such a lovely bride
what a shame she's fucked in the head they said
but you'll find the real thing instead
she'll patch up your tapestry that i shred
and hold your hand while dancing
never leave you standing
crestfallen on the landing
with champagne problems
your mom's ring in your pocket
her picture in your wallet
you won't remember all my
champagne problems
you won't remember all my
champagne problems
gleaming twinkling
eyes like sinking ships on waters
so inviting i almost jump in
but i don't like a gold rush gold rush
i don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
i don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
everybody wants you
everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
walk past quick brush
i don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
i don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
everybody wants you
but i don't like a gold rush
what must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
with your hair falling into place like dominoes
i see me padding across your wooden floors
with my eagles t-shirt hanging from the door
at dinner parties i call you out on your contrarian shit
and the coastal town we wandered 'round had never seen a love as pure as it
and then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'cause it could never be
'cause i don't like a gold rush gold rush
i don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
i don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
everybody wants you
everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
walk past quick brush
i don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
i don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
everybody wants you
but i don't like a gold rush
what must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
with your hair falling into place like dominoes
my mind turns your life into folklore
i can't dare to dream about you anymore
at dinner parties i won't call you out on your contrarian shit
and the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'cause it will never be
gleaming twinkling
eyes like sinking ships on waters
so inviting i almost jump in
if i wanted to know who you were hanging with
while i was gone i would've asked you
it's the kind of cold fogs up windshield glass
but i felt it when i passed you
there's an ache in you put there by the ache in me
but if it's all the same to you
it's the same to me
so we could call it even
you could call me babe for the weekend
'tis the damn season write this down
i'm stayin' at my parents' house
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown
i parked my car right between the methodist
and the school that used to be ours
the holidays linger like bad perfume
you can run but only so far
i escaped it too remember how you watched me leave
but if it's okay with you it's okay with me
we could call it even
you could call me babe for the weekend
'tis the damn season write this down
i'm stayin' at my parents' house
and the road not taken looks real good now
time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires
now i'm missing your smile hear me out
we could just ride around
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown
sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
i won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
so i'll go back to l.a. and the so-called friends
who'll write books about me if i ever make it
and wonder about the only soul
who can tell which smiles i'm fakin'
and the heart i know i'm breakin' is my own
to leave the warmest bed i've ever known
we could call it even
even though i'm leaving
and i'll be yours for the weekend
'tis the damn season
we could call it even
you could call me babe for the weekend
'tis the damn season write this down
i'm stayin' at my parents' house
and the road not taken looks real good now
time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires
now i'm missing your smile hear me out
we could just ride around
and the road not taken looks real good now
and it always leads to you and my hometown
it always leads to you and my hometown
i sit and watch you reading with your head low
i wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
i sit and watch you
i notice everything you do or don't do
you're so much older and wiser and i
i wait by the door like i'm just a kid
use my best colors for your portrait
lay the table with the fancy shit
and watch you tolerate it
if it's all in my head tell me now
tell me i've got it wrong somehow
i know my love should be celebrated
but you tolerate it
i greet you with a battle hero's welcome
i take your indiscretions all in good fun
i sit and listen i polish plates until they gleam and glisten
you're so much older and wiser and i
i wait by the door like i'm just a kid
use my best colors for your portrait
lay the table with the fancy shit
and watch you tolerate it
if it's all in my head tell me now
tell me i've got it wrong somehow
i know my love should be celebrated
but you tolerate it
while you were out building other worlds where was i?
where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
i made you my temple my mural my sky
now i'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
drawing hearts in the byline
always taking up too much space or time
you assume i'm fine but what would you do if i
break free and leave us in ruins
took this dagger in me and removed it
gain the weight of you then lose it
believe me i could do it
if it's all in my head tell me now
tell me i've got it wrong somehow
i know my love should be celebrated
but you tolerate it
i sit and watch you
he did it
he did it
este's a friend of mine
we meet up every tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
este's been losin' sleep
her husband's actin' different and it smells like infidelity
she says that ain't my merlot on his mouth
that ain't my jewelry on our joint account

she says i think he did it but i just can't prove it
i think he did it but i just can't prove it
i think he did it but i just can't prove it

este wasn't there tuesday night at olive garden
at her job or anywhere

and i noticed when i passed his house
his truck has got some brand new tires
and his mistress moved in
sleeps in este's bed and everything
no there ain't no doubt
somebody's gotta catch him out 'cause
i think he did it but i just can't prove ithe did it

good thing este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
she was with me dude
good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
they think she did it but they just can't prove it
they think she did it but they just can't prove it

no no body no crime
i wasn't lettin' up until the day he

no no body no crime
i wasn't lettin' up until the day he died
honey when i'm above the trees
i see this for what it is
but now i'm right down in it all the years i've given
is just shit we're dividin' up
showed you all of my hiding spots
i was dancing when the music stopped
and in the disbelief i can't face reinvention
i haven't met the new me yet
there'll be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you
both of these things can be true
there is happiness
past the blood and bruise
past the curses and cries
beyond the terror in the nightfall
haunted by the look in my eyes
that would've loved you for a lifetime
leave it all behind
and there is happiness
tell me when did your winning smile
begin to look like a smirk?
when did all our lessons start to look like weapons
pointed at my deepest hurt?
i hope she'll be a beautiful fool
who takes my spot next to you
no i didn't mean that
sorry i can't see facts through all of my fury
you haven't met the new me yet
there'll be happiness after me
but there was happiness because of me
both of these things i believe
there is happiness
in our history across ourgreat divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight leave it all behind
and there is happiness
i can't make it go away by making you a villain
i guess it's the price i paid forseven years in heaven
and i pulled your body into mine
every goddamn night now i get fake niceties
no one teaches you what to do
when a good man hurts you
and you know you hurt him too
honey when i'm above the trees
i see it for what it is
but now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
after giving you the best i had
tell me what to give after that
all you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
you haven't met the new me yet
and i think she'll give you that
there'll be happiness after you
but there was happiness because of you too
both of these things can be true
there is happiness
in our history across our great divide
there is a glorious sunrise
dappled with the flickers of light
from the dress i wore at midnight leave it all behind
oh leave it all behind
leave it all behind
and there is happiness
hey dorothea do you ever stop and think about me?
when we were younger down in the park
honey making a lark of the misery
you got shiny friends since you left town
a tiny screen's the only place i see you now
and i got nothing but well wishes for ya
ooh this place is the same as it ever was
ooh but you won't like it that way
it's never too late to come back to my side
the stars in your eyes shined brighter in tupelo
and if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
you know that you'll always know me dorothea uh-uh
dorothea ah-ah
ooh you're a queen sellin' dreams sellin' makeup and magazines
ooh from you i'd buy anything
hey dorothea do you ever stop and think about me?
when it was calmer skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
and damn dorothea they all wanna be ya
but are you still the same soul i met under the bleachers? well
ooh i guess i'll never know
ooh and you'll go on with the show
but it's never too late to come back to my side
the stars in your eyes shined brighter in tupelo
and if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
you know you'll always know me dorothea uh-uh
dorothea ah-ah
ooh ooh
ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
ooh ooh
ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
dorothea ah-ah-ah
ah-ah
ooh
break my soul in two looking for you
but you're right here
if i can't relate to you anymore
then who am i related to?
and if this is the long haul
how'd we get here so soon?
did i close my fist around something delicate?
did i shatter you?
and i'm sitting on a bench in coney island
wondering where did my baby go?
the fast times the bright lights the merry go
sorry for not making you my centerfold
over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments close your eyes
and it gets colder and colder
when the sun goes down
the question pounds my head
what's a lifetime of achievement
if i pushed you to the edge?
but you were too polite to leave me
and do you miss the rogue
who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
will you forgive my soul
when you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
'cause we were like the mall before the internet
it was the one place to be
the mischief the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments close your eyes
and it gets colder and colder
when the sun goes down
were you waiting at our old spot
in the tree line
by the gold clock
did i leave you hanging every single day?
were you standing in the hallway
with a big cake happy birthday
did i paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
a universe away
and when i got into the accident
the sight that flashed before me was your face
but when i walked up to the podium i think that i forgot to say your name
i'm on a bench in coney island
wondering where did my baby go?
the fast times the bright lights the merry go
sorry for not making you my centerfold
over and over
lost again with no surprises
disappointments close your eyes
and it gets colder and colder
when the sun goes down
when the sun goes down
the sight that flashed before me was your face
when the sun goes down
but i think that i forgot to say your name
over and over
sorry for not making you my making you my
making you my centerfold
how's one to know?
i'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
in a faith-forgotten land
in from the snow
your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
tarnished but so grand
and the old widow goes to the stone every day
but i don't i just sit here and wait
grieving for the living
oh goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking mine but it's been promised to another
oh i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone your ivy grows
and now i'm covered in you
i wish to know
the fatal flaw that makes you long to be
magnificently cursed
he's in the room
your opal eyes are all i wish to see
he wants what's only yours
oh goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking minebut it's been promised to another
oh i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone your ivy grows
and now i'm covered
clover blooms in the fields
spring breaks loose the time is near
what would he do if he found us out?
crescent moon coast is clear
spring breaks loose but so does fear
he's gonna burn this house to the ground
how's one to know?
i'd live and die for moments that we stole
on begged and borrowed time
so tell me to run
or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
and drink my husband's wine
oh goddamn
my pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
taking mine but it's been promised to another
oh i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone your ivy grows
and now i'm covered in you
and i'm covered in you
so yeah it's a fire
it's a goddamn blaze in the dark
and you started it
you started it
so yeah it's a war
it's the goddamn fight of my life
and you started it
you started it
oh i can't
stop you putting roots in my dreamland
my house of stone your ivy grows
and now i'm covered
in you in you
now i'm covered in you
in you
and the tennis court was covered up
with some tent-like thing
and you asked me to dance
but i said dancin' is a dangerous game
oh i thought
this is gonna be one of those things
now i know
i'm never gonna love again
i've got some tricks up my sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me
never wanted love
just a fancy car
now i'm waiting by the phone
like i'm sitting in an airport bar
you had some tricks up your sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me
perched in the dark
telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
like it could be love
i could be the way forward
only if they pay for it
you're a bandit like me
eyes full of stars
hustling for the good life
never thought i'd meet you here
it could be love
we could be the way forward
and i know i'll pay for it
you're a cowboy like me
perched in the dark
telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
like it could be love
i could be the way forward
only if they pay for it
you're a bandit like me
eyes full of stars
hustling for the good life
never thought i'd meet you here
it could be love
we could be the way forward
and i know i'll pay for it
and the skeletons in both our closets
plotted hard to fuck this up
and the old men that i've swindled
really did believe i was the one
and the ladies lunching have their stories about
when you passed through town
but that was all before i locked it down
now you hang from my lips
like the gardens of babylon
with your boots beneath my bed
forever is the sweetest con
i've had some tricks up my sleeve
takes one to know one
you're a cowboy like me
and i'm never gonna love again
i'm never gonna love again
i'm never gonna love again
fatefully
i tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
misery
like the war of words i shouted in my sleep
and you passed right by
i was in the alley surrounded on all sides
the knife cuts both ways
if the shoe fits walk in it 'til your high heels break
and i fell from the pedestal
right down the rabbit hole
long story short it was a bad time
pushed from the precipice
clung to the nearest lips
long story short it was the wrong guy
now i'm all about you
i'm all about you ah
yeah yeah
i'm all about you ah
yeah yeah
actually
i always felt i must look better in the rear view
missing me
at the golden gates they once held the keys to
when i dropped my sword
i threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
and we live in peace
but if someone comes at us this time i'm ready
'cause i fell from the pedestal
right down the rabbit hole
long story short it was a bad time
pushed from the precipice
clung to the nearest lips
long story short it was the wrong guy
now i'm all about you
i'm all about you ah
yeah yeah
i'm all about you
no more keepin' score
now i just keep you warm keep you warm
no more tug of war
now i just know there's more know there's more
no more keepin' score
now i just keep you warm keep you warm
and my waves meet your shore
ever andevermore
past me
i wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
your nemeses
will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
and he's passing by
rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
and he feels like home
if the shoe fits walk in it everywhere you go
and i fell from the pedestal
right down the rabbit hole
long story short it was a bad time
pushed from the precipice
climbed right back up the cliff
long story short i survived
now i'm all about you
and now i'm all about you ah
and now i'm all about you
and now i'm all about you ah
yeah yeah
i'm all about you
and now yeah yeah
i'm all about you
long story short it was a bad time
long story short i survived
never be so kind
you forget to be clever
never be so clever
you forget to be kind
and if i didn't know better
i'd think you were talking to me now
if i didn't know better
i'd think you were still around
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive you're alive in my head
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive so alive
never be so polit?
you forget your power
never wield such power
you forget to be polite
and if i didn't know better
i'd think you were listening to me now
if i didn't know better
i'd think you were still around
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive you're alive in my head
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive so alive
the autumn chill that wakes me up
you loved the amber skies so much
long limbs and frozen swims
you'd always go past where our feet could touch
and i complained the whole way there
the car ride back and up the stairs
i should've asked you questions
i should've asked you how to be
asked you to write it down for me
should've kept every grocery store receipt
'cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
watched as you signed your name marjorie
all your closets of backlogged dreams
and how you left them all to me
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive you're alive in my head
what died didn't stay dead
what died didn't stay dead
you're alive so alive
and if i didn't know better
i'd think you were singing to me now
if i didn't know better
i'd think you were still around
i know better
but i still feel you all around
i know better
but you're still around
it's been a long time
and seeing the shape of your name
still spells out pain
it wasn't right
the way it all went down
looks like you know that now
yes i got your letter
yes i'm doing better
it cut deep to know ya right to the bone
yes i got your letter
yes i'm doing better
i know that it's over i don't need your
closure your closure
don't treat me like
some situation that needs to be handled
i'm fine with my spite
and my tears and my beers and my candles
i can feel yousmoothing me over

it cut deep to know ya right to the bone
yes i got your letter
yes i'm doing better
i know that it's over i don't need your
closure your closure
your closure your closure
i know i'm just a wrinkle in your new life
staying friends would iron it out so nice
guilty guiltyreaching out across the sea
that you put between you and me
but it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary
yes i got your letter
yes i'm doing better
it cut deep to know ya right to the bone
yes i got your letter
yes i'm doing better
i know that it's over i don't need your
closure closure your closure
your closure
gray november
i've been down since july
motion capture
put me in a bad light
i replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
trying to find the one where i went wrong
writing letters
addressed to the fire
and i was catching my breath
staring out an open window
catching my death
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
that this pain would be for
evermore
hey december
guess i'm feeling unmoored
can't remember
what i used to fight for
i rewind the tape but all it does is pause
on the very moment all was lost
sending signals
to be double-crossed
and i was catching my breath
barefoot in the wildest winter
catching my death
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
that this pain would be for
evermore
evermore
can't not think of all the cost
and the things that will be lost
oh can we just get a pause?
to be certain we'll be tall again
whether weather be the frost
or the violence of the dog days
i'm on waves out being tossed
is there a line that i could just go cross?
and when i was shipwrecked can't think of all the cost
i thought of you all the things that will be lost now
in the cracks of light can we just get a pause?
i dreamed of you to be certain we'll be tall again if you think of all the costs
it was real enough whether weather be the frost
to get me through or the violence of the dog days
or the violence of the dog days
out on waves being tossed
i'm on waves out being tossed
i swear is there a line that we can just go cross?
you were there
and i was catching my breath
floors of a cabin creaking under my step
and i couldn't be sure
i had a feeling so peculiar
this pain wouldn't be for
evermore
evermore
evermore
this pain wouldn't be for evermore
evermore
friends break up friends get married
strangers get born strangers get buried
trends change rumors fly through new skies
but i'm right where you left me
matches burn after the other
pages turn and stick to each other
wages earned and lessons learned
but i i'm right where you left me
help i'm still at the restaurant
still sitting in a corner i haunt
cross-legged in the dim light
they say what a sad sight
i i swear you could hear a hair pin drop
right when i felt the moment stop
glass shattered on the white cloth
everybody moved on i i stayed there
dust collected on my pinned-up hair
they expected me to find somewhere
some perspective but i sat and stared
right where you left me
you left me no you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever
you left me you left me no oh you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever
did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
time went on for everybody else she won't know it
she's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
how it was supposed to be
did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
breakups happen every day you don't have to lose it
she's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
and you're sitting in front of me
at the restaurant when i was still the one you want
cross-legged in the dim light everything was just right
i i could feel the mascara run
you told me that you met someone
glass shattered on the white cloth
everybody moved on
help i'm still at the restaurant
still sitting in a corner i haunt
cross-legged in the dim light
they say what a sad sight
i i stayed there
dust collected on my pinned-up hair
i'm sure that you got a wife out there
kids and christmas but i'm unaware
'cause i'm right where i cause no harm
mind my business
if our love died young
i can't bear witness
and it's been so long
but if you ever think you got it wrong
i'm right where
you left me
you left me no oh you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever
you left me
you left me no oh you left me no
you left me no choice but to stay here forever
when the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
you ask for the tab
or that moment again he's insisting that friends
look at each other like that
when the words of a sister come back in whispers
that prove she was not in fact what she seemed
not a twin from your dreams
she's a crook who was caught
that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
you know when it's time to go
twenty years at your job
then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
or trying to stay for the kids
when keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse
that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
you know when it's time to go
sometimes giving up is the strong thing
sometimes to run is the brave thing
sometimes walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
sometimes giving up is the strong thing
sometimes to run is the brave thing
sometimes walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
fifteen years fifteen million tears
begging 'til my knees bled
i gave it my all he gave me nothing at all
then wondered why i left
now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
praying to his greed
he's got my past frozen behind glass
but i've got me
that old familiar body ache
the snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
i know when it's time to go
sometimes giving up is the strong thing
sometimes to run is the brave thing
sometimes walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
sometimes giving up is the strong thing
sometimes to run is the brave thing
sometimes walking out is the one thing
that will find you the right thing
that will find you the right thing
and you know in your soul
you know in your soul
when it's time to go
you know you know you know you know
when it's time to go
so then you go
then you go
you just go
