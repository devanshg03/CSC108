"""Week 9 Perform - Part 2"""

# file name: w09_markus.py
# also needs file: fluffy_functions.py to be in the same folder
#
# Complete the following steps:
# (1) In addition to this file, download and open 
#     fluffy_functions.py in Wing101.
# (2) Review the test cases you chose for the all_fluffy function as part of 
#     the Choosing Test Cases exercise in the Week 9 lectures.
# (3) Implement the test cases you chose as test functions below.
#     Make sure you save your file regularly.
# (4) Run your tests on the correct version of all_fluffy from the 
#     fluffy_functions.py file, where it is named all_fluffy_v0.  We have
#     provided an import statement below to help you do that.  Make sure your
#     tests all run and pass when the correct code is provided.
# (5) Run your tests on the buggy versions of all_fluffy from the 
#     fluffy_functions.py file. The simplest way to do that is to make the
#     first import statement that we have provided into a comment, and then
#     uncomment one of the import statements that follow.  To test a different
#     buggy version of all_fluffy, uncomment a different import statement.
# (6) When convinced that your tests are complete, submit your modified
#     w09_markus.py file to MarkUs. You can find instructions on submitting a
#     file to MarkUs in the Week *2* Perform -> Accessing Part 2 of the
#     Week 2 Perform (For Credit) on PCRS.
# (7) Verify you have submit the right file to MarkUs by downloading it again
#     and checking it is the one you meant to submit.
# (8) We have also provided a checker test for you to run in MarkUs. This week
#     the checker runs your tests on a correct version of the all_fluffy
#     function.  We will not be marking your style on this exercise, so there
#     will be no PyTA check. We will run additional tests with different
#     versions of buggy code when we mark your submission to determine whether
#     your test suite is complete.
#
# NOTE: **Restart the Python shell** before running this module to ensure that
#       the desired all_fluffy function is imported and called.  Do this shell
#       restart each time you run this module.

# Uncomment ONE of the following "from fluffy_functions" statements, depending
# on which version of all_fluffy you wish to test. Only add/delete the comment
# (#) symbol and blank.

# For running the checker on MarkUs, uncomment the _v0 version and comment out
# the other "from fluffy_functions" statements.
